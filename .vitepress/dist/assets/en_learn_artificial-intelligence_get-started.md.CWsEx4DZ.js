These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a formal language designed to communicate with computers. Programmers use programming languages to write code, which is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. Programming involves breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts and then creating a series of steps to solve each part. Programmers use various techniques and tools to write, test, and debug their code, ensuring that it runs correctly and efficiently.</p><h3 id="a-brief-history-of-programming" tabindex="-1">A Brief History of Programming <a class="header-anchor" href="#a-brief-history-of-programming" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;A Brief History of Programming&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The history of programming dates back to the early 19th century, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage" target="_blank">Charles Babbage</a> designed the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1quina_anal%C3%ADtica" target="_blank">Analytical Engine</a>, a mechanical computer that could be programmed using punched cards. However, it was not until the mid-20th century that programming as we know it today began to take shape.</p><p>Here are some key milestones in the history of programming:</p><h3 id="_1936-the-turing-machine" tabindex="-1">1936: The Turing Machine <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1936-the-turing-machine" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1936: The Turing Machine&quot;">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a>, a British mathematician, proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine" target="_blank">Turing machine</a>, a theoretical model of computation that laid the foundation for modern computer science and programming.</p><h3 id="_1940s-the-first-programming-languages" tabindex="-1">1940s: The First Programming Languages <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1940s-the-first-programming-languages" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1940s: The First Programming Languages&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The first programming languages, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl" target="_blank">Plankalkül</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC" target="_blank">ENIAC</a>&#39;s Short Code, were developed in the 1940s.
