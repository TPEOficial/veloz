Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a specific class. This algorithm is commonly employed in scenarios where a binary classification is needed, with a threshold of 0.5 used to determine class membership.</p><h2 id="logistic-regression-process" tabindex="-1">Logistic Regression Process <a class="header-anchor" href="#logistic-regression-process" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Logistic Regression Process&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In logistic regression, the algorithm calculates the weighted sum of input features and applies a sigmoid function to this sum, transforming it into a probability value between 0 and 1. If the probability is greater than 0.5, the model predicts the instance belongs to the positive class; otherwise, it predicts the negative class. The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, maps real numbers to a range of 0 to 1, facilitating the classification process.</p><img src="https://cdn.tpeoficial.com/learn/Tm1Kv3Ox3Hh5Rq3Yj3Qx1Tx3Ia3Gd9Sc6Ro3Zd3O" loading="lazy" width="400" height="277"><h2 id="decision-boundary" tabindex="-1">Decision Boundary <a class="header-anchor" href="#decision-boundary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Decision Boundary&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One of the key concepts in logistic regression is the decision boundary, which separates the classes in a binary classification problem. By plotting the data points and the decision boundary, it becomes clear how the algorithm distinguishes between the different classes based on the input features.</p><h2 id="application-in-real-world-scenarios" tabindex="-1">Application in Real-World Scenarios <a class="header-anchor" href="#application-in-real-world-scenarios" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Application in Real-World Scenarios&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Logistic regression finds extensive use in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and epidemiology, due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. It allows for the analysis of the relationship between independent variables and a binary outcome, providing insights into the predictive power of different factors.</p><h2 id="model-training-and-evaluation" tabindex="-1">Model Training and Evaluation <a class="header-anchor" href="#model-training-and-evaluation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Model Training and Evaluation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>To implement logistic regression, datasets are split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained using the training data. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used to assess the model&#39;s performance on the test data.</p><p>In conclusion, logistic regression is a powerful algorithm in Machine Learning that is widely used for binary classification tasks. By understanding the principles of logistic regression, its application in various domains, and the process of training and evaluating the model, one can leverage this algorithm effectively for predictive analytics and decision-making.</p>',13),o=[t];function r(c,l,d,g,h,p){return a(),i("div",null,o)}const f=e(n,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
