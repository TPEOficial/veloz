## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating instructions that a computer can follow to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a formal language designed to communicate with computers. Programmers use programming languages to write code, which is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do.
Programming involves breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts and then creating a series of steps to solve each part. Programmers use various techniques and tools to write, test, and debug their code, ensuring that it runs correctly and efficiently.

### A Brief History of Programming

The history of programming dates back to the early 19th century, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage" target="_blank">Charles Babbage</a> designed the <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A1quina_anal%C3%ADtica" target="_blank">Analytical Engine</a>, a mechanical computer that could be programmed using punched cards. However, it was not until the mid-20th century that programming as we know it today began to take shape.

Here are some key milestones in the history of programming:

### 1936: The Turing Machine

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">Alan Turing</a>, a British mathematician, proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_engine" target="_blank">Turing machine</a>, a theoretical model of computation that laid the foundation for modern computer science and programming.

### 1940s: The First Programming Languages

The first programming languages, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl" target="_blank">Plankalk√ºl</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC" target="_blank">ENIAC</a>'s Short Code, were developed in the 1940s. These early languages were designed for specific machines and were not very user-friendly.

### 1950s: High-Level Programming Languages

In the 1950s, high-level programming languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran" target="_blank">FORTRAN</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">LISP</a> were developed. These languages were more human-readable and could be used on multiple machines, making programming more accessible.

### 1960s: Structured Programming

In the 1960s, structured programming techniques were introduced, which emphasized the use of control structures like loops and conditional statements to create more organized and maintainable code.

### 1970s: Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming ([OOP](/en/learn/development-concepts/object-oriented-programming)) emerged in the 1970s, allowing programmers to create reusable code and organize it into objects with properties and methods.

### 1980s: Personal Computers and GUI

The 1980s saw the rise of personal computers and the development of graphical user interfaces ([GUI](/en/learn/development-concepts/gui)), which made programming more accessible to a wider audience.

### 1990s: The Internet and Web Development
The 1990s brought the widespread adoption of the internet and the development of web programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which enabled the creation of dynamic websites and web applications.
