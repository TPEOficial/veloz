# Programming Language Types

## High-Level Programming Languages

High-level programming languages are closer to human language and easier to read and write. Some examples include:
 - Python - created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_blank">Guido van Rossum</a>.
 - Java - developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling" target="_blank">James Gosling</a> and others at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" target="_blank">Sun Microsystems</a>.
 - C++ - created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup" target="_blank">Bjarne Stroustrup</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a>.
 - JavaScript - developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich" target="_blank">Brendan Eich</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape" target="_blank">Netscape</a>.

## Low-Level Programming Languages

Low-level languages are closer to computer architecture and more challenging to read and write. Some examples include:
 - Assembly - each instruction corresponds to a CPU operation.
 - Machine Code - sequences of ones and zeros that the CPU can directly understand.

## Declarative vs. Imperative Languages

Declarative languages describe what should be done, while imperative languages describe how to do it. Examples include:
 - Declarative: SQL for databases, HTML for web pages.
 - Imperative: C, Java, Python.

## Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages

Interpreted languages run directly, while compiled languages are translated to machine code first. Examples include:
 - Interpreted: Python, JavaScript.
 - Compiled: C, C++, Java.

## Multi-Paradigm Languages

_"A multi-paradigm programming language is one that allows the implementation of different programming styles. This means that you can write code in several paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, functional programming, imperative programming, among others, all within the same language. For example, in a multi-paradigm language like Python, you can write object-oriented, functional and imperative code as needed in your program. The same is true for other languages such as JavaScript and C++."_

Some languages support multiple programming paradigms:
 - C++ - supports object-oriented and generic programming.
 - Python - supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative programming.
 - JavaScript - supports object-oriented, functional, and prototype-based programming.
