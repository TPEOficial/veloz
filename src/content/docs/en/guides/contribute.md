# Contribute

## How can I contribute?
 - Create a new course, blog or tutorial.
 - Translate an existing course, blog or tutorial.
 - Correct or improve an existing course, blog or tutorial.
 - Increase the visibility of the project, or propose new improvements.


## Guidelines
 - The proposed pages must be in md or mdx format (mdx will only be accepted in very specific cases).
 - You must maintain a clear structure and everything explained should be as simple as possible.

### On your markdown page
**To insert images:** Send us the image to our Discord or attach it in your proposal, remember it must be of good quality. In the image tag you must put in the `src` the name of the image not the path, we will replace it with an ID of our CDN, add the property `loading="lazy"` and the properties `width`, and `height`.

Example:
```html
<img src="IMAGE_NAME" loading="lazy" width="IMAGE_SIZE_WIDTH" height="IMAGE_SIZE_HEIGHT">
```

**To insert links:** For celebrities, companies or any tangible invention you should add its link to Wikipedia if it exists and in the language of the page as follows.

Example:
```html
Python - created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" target="_blank">Guido van Rossum</a>.
```

### Before sending your proposal
 - Make sure there are no spelling mistakes.
 - Add links to Wikipedia for specific mentions such as creators or companies.
 - Tell us where you want to add your proposal, whether it is a course from scratch, a section for an existing course, a blog page, a tutorial, etc.

### Other types of proposals
For other proposals related to the web, design, functionality, routes, or other improvements you can send us your proposed code to Discord or GitHub, or simply if you don't have the code you can communicate us your idea via Discord.
